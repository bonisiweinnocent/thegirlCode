    <p1>GBV/Abuse is something that no one should have to deal with at all. But
      alas, we live in an imperfect world and from time to time we find
      ourselves faced with these challenges. Nonetheless, this is even more
      reason why we need to bend together as humanity to try and support each
      other as much as we can. And that is why we have decided to provide a
      platform where people can do just that. The platform also allows
      therapists to offer their services free of charge. The purpose of this
      website is to provide women with the comfort of knowing that they do not
      have to deal with everything alone as well as the strength to face their
      situations and share them with other women who might need to hear it.
      Hence the name "NayaBasadiMaatla" which simply translates to
      GiveWomenStrength "For the People, By the People".</p1>
